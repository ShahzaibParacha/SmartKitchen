We had a good amount of coherence and communication to make it through together. We were able to follow most, if not all, Agile methodologies and principles and engineer the app development process around them. We managed to get 83% Test Coverage overall.</p><h3>The Bad</h3><p>HSQLDB. Malfunctioning Integration Tests. Android Studio and it&#x27;s shortcomings for days. Designing UI&#x27;s for different screen sizes.</p><h2>In Hindsight...</h2><p>Pair Programming was one of the better decisions we made. We set time aside to work on the app together. This helped us manage problems as soon as they showed up. Five heads thinking together is better than one. This mainly helped us when we were implementing the Database, and Testing because we had delegated tasks and the pair programming aspect allowed us to communicate to manage time and efforts well.</p><p>Implementing HSQLDB felt like interacting with technology that will turn into legacy software soon (hopefully..). It would be better to research more database options and incorporate something that is well-documented and will likely stay alive longer. This would have also helped us in testing cause we had issues when copying over Database scripts.</p><p>Knowing what we know now, if we were to start over there are a few things that we would do differently. We would add more features and gain more horizontal functionality in our app. This would allow us to iterate better on those features instead of implementing them at once without much room to grow and correct organically. We would also vote on features we see fit, and only include them if there is majority support, so that less valuable features are not taking priority over the more important features.</p></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/PostMortem","query":{},"buildId":"eQB-pQ0SNDbdaPz6NA7pZ","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-28654a8145d7603786fc.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.4b1beca48388539e3889.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/07a7eb8890d26bfdebb145714f263cdc3457e69d.d12f0f1a60897c5511ed.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-5e553305ca9826d624e8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-6f2016f55374c86158ac.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/PostMortem-47a4e9019544861fb892.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/eQB-pQ0SNDbdaPz6NA7pZ/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/eQB-pQ0SNDbdaPz6NA7pZ/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
