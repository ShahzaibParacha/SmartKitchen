# Branching Strategy

We follow the ```GitHub Flow``` strategy for our project.

### Branch Naming

Branches are created and implemented following a feature named after one of our user stories for each iteration. Wording may be minimized for ease of use but the essence remains the same.

### Merging to Master

```Master``` branch for us is the production branch. This is the finalized product and should only contain tested and error-free code. Merges are made to ```Master``` only when all memebers of the team have agreed by giving the commit a thumbs up, which means the iteration follows the guidelines and requirements for that specific feature appropriately. 

### Commiting to Local Branches

When we implement a new feature it gets implemented as a new branch. We follow the commit freqeunt approach so for every little update there is a commit so changes can be effectively tracked. Each commit message must declare what specific feature(s) that has been addressed.
