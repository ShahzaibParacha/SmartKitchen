# Refrigerator Manager Vision Statement

Refrigerator Manager is a food inventory and grocery list manager for Android devices. This application will assist users in managing their current kitchen inventory. Aside from managing their kitchen's inventory, the application can also assist the user in their next grocery shopping by providing suggestions on what to purchase for the next grocery trip. The application aims to take average kitchen routines to another level by providing users with functions to keep track of inventory as well as options for a better and easier grocery shopping experience and recipe writing.
 
Refrigerator Manager will have features that focus on assisting people in managing their inventory easily. The application will help users in managing their expenses, save time for users in making grocery lists automatically instead of writing down from scratch. The application will also be able to assist the users in tracking calories for health management. Users will also be able to use the application as a virtual cookbook, enabling them to write, copy, and share recipes to other users.
 
Refrigerator Manager targets users who frequent the kitchen and make food on a regular basis. It is not focused on satisfying the needs of commercial establishments however, small scale restaurants may find benefit in using the application.  It can help determine if the kitchen is running out of ingredients that suffices the requirements in order to make the food. Which in turn also helps the restaurant run a bit smoother as they can plan to restock.
 
The success criteria that we are looking for is the number of users that can get access to the app. As mentioned before, the main targets are users who are frequent in the kitchen and who oversee the restocking. The number of total recipes that are being added to the app is another measure of success that we can rely on to give us indication of the current state of the appâ€™s progression. Also, we can track the number of times the recipes are used and the total number of items that were added or removed from the pantry.
